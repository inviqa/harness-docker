Please follow the below steps to get started, if you encounter any issues installing the dependencies or provisioning the development environment, please check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section first.

## Development Environment

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

##### General

- Access to LastPass folders
  - `Shared-{{ @('workspace.name') }}-Servers` and `Shared-{{ @('workspace.name') }}-Accounts`

##### Docker

- A working Docker setup
  - On macOS, use [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
  - On Linux, add the official Docker repository described under the "Server" section on [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and install the "docker-ce" package.
    You will also need to have a recent [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version - at least `1.26.0`.

#### Setup

1. Install [workspace](https://github.com/my127/workspace)
2. Copy the LastPass entry "{{ @('workspace.name') }}: Development Environment Key" to a new blank file named `workspace.override.yml` in the project root.
3. Run `ws install`

{% include blocks ~ 'websites.md.twig' %}

**Additional services**:
- Mailhog: [https://mail.my127.site](https://mail.my127.site)
{% if @('services.rabbitmq.enabled') -%}
- RabbitMQ: [https://{{ @('rabbitmq.external_host') }}](https://{{ @('rabbitmq.external_host') }})
{% endif -%}
{% if @('services.jenkins.enabled') -%}
- Jenkins: [https://{{ @('jenkins.external_host') }}](https://{{ @('jenkins.external_host') }})
{% endif %}
{% if @('services.solr.enabled') -%}
- Solr: [https://solr-{{ @('hostname') }}/solr/](https://solr-{{ @('hostname') }}/solr/)
{% endif -%}

### Development environment cleanup

To stop the development environment, run `ws disable`.

To start the development environment again, run `ws enable`.

To remove the development environment, run `ws destroy`.

### Harness Version Updates

If you have been notified that a harness version upgrade is available by your team, do the following.

If you have an existing environment running:
```bash
ws harness update existing
```

or if you don't have one running right now or would like to set up from fresh:
```bash
ws harness update fresh
```

{% for readme_block in @('framework.readme_blocks') %}
{% include blocks ~ readme_block ~ '.md.twig' %}
{% endfor %}

{% if @('services.mysql.enabled') -%}
### MySQL Access

MySQL can be used either via command line tools via `ws db console` or via GUI tools.

In your GUI tool, set up a new connection to localhost with the port being the returned port number from:
```bash
ws port mysql
```

{% if @('database.port_forward') == "" -%}
This port will change each time the project environment is started, as docker will allocate a random unused port
on your host machine.

To set a consistent port for this project, choose a port number that you think will be unique across all projects
that your developers will encounter (e.g. not 3306!). Acceptable range of ports is 1-65535.

Once you have a port number, you can define it in the workspace.yml with:
```yaml
attribute('database.port_forward'): portNumberHere
```
{%- endif %}

The connection username and password is listed under the `mysql` service environment section in `docker-compose.yml` in
the project root.
{% endif %}

### Performance on macOS

Page load times with Docker Desktop for Mac can vary considerably due to the sharing of files from the macOS disk to the small
virtual machine that docker is running inside.
This is especially so when there is a large quantity of small files, such as with a large composer node_modules or
vendor folder.

[Mutagen](https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/docker) is a tool to synchronise files between host machine and
docker containers.
It enables production-like performance at the cost of having to synchronise files with an intermediate
"data" container.

{% if @('mutagen') %}
Mutagen is enabled on the development environment.
{% else %}
If it takes over 2 seconds to load a page, you should consider enabling mutagen by adding the following
to `workspace.override.yml` in the project root, or after testing it and the whole team would like to use it,
`workspace.yml` in the project root:

```yaml
attribute('mutagen'): true
```

Then running `ws harness prepare && ws disable && ws enable`.
The initial sync can take between 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the project directory.

If committing the attribute changes to `workspace.yml`, ensure the `Performance on macOS` section from
`.my127ws/application/skeleton/README.md` is copied to the project's README.md too!
{% endif %}

The following are some useful commands regarding Mutagen:
```bash
# To check the Mutagen sync status (sync is ready when status is "Watching for changes")
mutagen monitor
# To debug a sync error
mutagen list
```

### Common Issues

As setup issues are encountered please detail with step by step fix instructions, and where possible update the project or the upstream workspace harness itself to provide a more permanent fix.

* If you get a error that the TLS certificate has expired for the development website in your browser:
  * Restart the my127 global traefik proxy with `ws global service proxy restart`.
    This will fetch new TLS certificates for `*.my127.site`.
* If you use mutagen and operations such as `mutagen project pause` during `ws disable` or `mutagen daemon start` during `ws install` are hanging:
  * Check that your `mutagen version` is at least version 0.11.8, and upgrade mutagen if not.
